                <div id="description">
                    Cafe Justo is one of the first times that I 
                    really got to explore my entreprenuerial side.
                    My friend and I went to Agua Prieta, Mexico on an
                    immersion trip to learn about issues surrounding
                    the border. We got to meet many wonderful people,
                    especially those who work for the official Cafe
                    Justo in Mexico. They pride themselves on promoting
                    fair trade, great coffee, and family. <br> <br>

                    Grand opening is on May 4, 2018!!!

                <div id="description">
                    I'm one of the youngest LEED Green Associates in
                    the nation. A LEED Green Associate is who contractors
                    go to for sustainability advice. I really got into
                    the environmentalist movement simply because nature
                    is awesome. Sustainable design is really important
                    for the future, and I will continute to forge a path
                    where I can combine CS, EE, and environmentalism in
                    my career!

                    Proof-of-Concept Li-fi System

                <div id="description">
                    Light fascinates me and Wifi is part of my life. Why
                    not combine the two? This interesting concept was 
                    developed by Professor Harald Haas, who has a TED 
                    Talk about Li-Fi and why it's pretty awesome. I was just
                    tinkering around with some circuit parts and some 
                    C++ examples when I realized I could make my own
                    proof-of-concept system. I ended up actually completing
                    a really simple version for a science project back in
                    my junior year of high school, but I've done some iterations
                    since. <br><br>
                    If you want to see my code, it's on my github, linked down
                    below. Right now, it can transmit strings, given that you
                    have the proper parts!
